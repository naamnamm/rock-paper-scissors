## Summary
I got an MBA in Finance in 2019 and am currently working as an auditor for a Pharmaceutical company in Washington DC. Right after graduation, I was so passionate to learn how to code. It is awesome to be able to build things from scratch that could benefit people's life. This is how I start my journey as a programmer.

This is my third web app project. I worked through a lot of problem-solving and had to revisit a lot of basic javascript concepts. It was challenging at times but it's pretty awesome to see the end results.
